 * +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | disco | Prints topology change log as seen from the oldest node.                      |
 * |       | Timeframe for quering events can be specified in arguments.                   |
 * |       |                                                                               |
 * |       | Note that this command depends on GridGain events.                            |
 * |       |                                                                               |
 * |       | GridGain events can be individually enabled and disabled and disabled events  |
 * |       | can affect the results produced by this command. Note also that configuration |
 * |       | of Event Storage SPI that is responsible for temporary storage of generated   |
 * |       | events on each node can also affect the functionality of this command.        |
 * |       |                                                                               |
 * |       | By default - all events are enabled and GridGain stores last 10,000 local     |
 * |       | events on each node. Both of these defaults can be changed in configuration.  |

 * ====Specification====
 * {{{
 *     disco
 *     disco "{-t=<num>s|m|h|d} {-r} {-c=<n>}"
 * }}}
 *
 * ====Arguments====
 * {{{
 *     -t=<num>s|m|h|d
 *         Defines timeframe for querying events:
 *            =<num>s Events fired during last <num> seconds.
 *            =<num>m Events fired during last <num> minutes.
 *            =<num>h Events fired during last <num> hours.
 *            =<num>d Events fired during last <num> days.
 *     -r
 *         Defines whether sorting should be reversed.
 *     -c=<n>
 *         Defines the maximum events count that can be shown.
 * }}}
 *
 * ====Examples====
 * {{{
 *     disco
 *         Prints all discovery events sorted chronologically (oldest first).
 *     disco "-r"
 *         Prints all discovery events sorted chronologically in reversed order (newest first).
 *     disco "-t=2m"
 *         Prints discovery events fired during last two minutes sorted chronologically.
