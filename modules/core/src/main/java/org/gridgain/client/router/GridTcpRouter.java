/**
 * TCP router interface.
 * <p>
 * Router allows remote clients to connect to grid without direct access to
 * the network where grid is running. It accepts requests on the same protocol
 * as grid rest server and establish required connection to grid nodes
 * to serve them.
 * <p>
 * Below is an example on how to start TCP router with non-default configuration.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridTcpRouterConfiguration cfg =
 *     new GridTcpRouterConfiguration();
 *
 * cfg.setHost("router.appdomain.com");
 * cfg.setPort(11211);
 *
 * cfg.setServers(Arrays.asList(
 *     "node1.appdomain.com:11211",
 *     "node2.appdomain.com:11211"));
 *
 * GridRouterFactory.startTcpRouter(cfg);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that clients should be specifically configured in order to use router.
 * Please refer to {@link GridClientConfiguration#getServers()} and
 * {@link GridClientConfiguration#getRouters()} documentation for more details.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are managed through {@link GridRouterFactory}.
 *
 * @see GridTcpRouterConfiguration
