/**
 * Secure session SPI allows for session creation and validation, typically after authentication
 * has successfully happened. The main purpose of this SPI is to ensure that remote clients are
 * authenticated only once and upon successful authentication get issued a secure session token
 * to reuse for consequent requests (very much the same way like HTTP sessions work).
 * <p>
 * The default secure session SPI is {@link GridNoopSecureSessionSpi}
 * which permits any request.
 * <p>
 * Gridgain provides the following {@code GridSecureSessionSpi} implementations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *     {@link GridNoopSecureSessionSpi} - permits any request.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     {@code GridRememberMeSecureSessionSpi} -
 *     validates client session with remember-me session token.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> that multiple secure session SPIs may be started on the same grid node. In this case
 * GridGain will differentiate between them based on {@link #supported(GridSecuritySubjectType)}
 * value. The first SPI which returns {@code true} for a given subject type will be used for
 * session validation.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> this SPI (i.e. methods in this interface) should never be used directly. SPIs provide
 * internal view on the subsystem and is used internally by GridGain kernal. In rare use cases when
 * access to a specific implementation of this SPI is required - an instance of this SPI can be obtained
 * via {@link Grid#configuration()} method to check its configuration properties or call other non-SPI
 * methods. Note again that calling methods from this interface on the obtained instance can lead
 * to undefined behavior and explicitly not supported.
