/**
 * Data center replication (DR) interface.
 * <p>
 * DR is a process of transferring updates from a cache located in one topology to a cache located in another topology.
 * Usual use case for DR is synchronizing cache state between several geographically remote topologies through WAN.
 * <p>
 * DR operates on the following terms:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Data center</b> - particular GridGain topology with unique ID;</li>
 *     <li><b>Sender cache</b> - cache from which data is being replicated;</li>
 *     <li><b>Receiver cache</b> - cache which applies updates from remote data center;</li>
 *     <li><b>Sender hub</b> - node which accumulates updates from sender data nodes and sends that to receiver hub in
 *     remote data center;</li>
 *     <li><b>receiver hub</b> - node which receives updates from remote data center sender hub and applies them to
 *     receiver data nodes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Cache is considered as sender in case it has {@link GridCacheConfiguration#getDrSenderConfiguration()}, and it is
 * considered as receiver cache in case it has {@link GridCacheConfiguration#getDrReceiverConfiguration()}.
 * <p>
 * Node is considered as sender hub in case it has {@link GridConfiguration#getDrSenderHubConfiguration()},
 * and it is considered as receiver hub in case it has
 * {@link GridConfiguration#getDrReceiverHubConfiguration()}.
 * <p>
 * Particular cache can be both sender and receiver at the same time. Particular node can be both sender and receiver
 * hub and host sender/receiver caches at the same time.
 * <p>
 * This API provides ability to manage DR process on sender cache node as well as get metrics for sender cache,
 * receiver cache, sender hub and receiver hub.
