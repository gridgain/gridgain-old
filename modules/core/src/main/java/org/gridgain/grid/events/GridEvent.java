/**
 * Grid events are used for notification about what happens within the grid. Note that by
 * design GridGain keeps all events generated on the local node locally and it provides
 * APIs for performing a distributed queries across multiple nodes:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link GridEvents#remoteQuery(GridPredicate , long, int...)} - querying
 *          events occurred on the nodes specified, including remote nodes.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link GridEvents#localQuery(GridPredicate, int...)} - querying only local
 *          events stored on this local node.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link GridEvents#localListen(GridPredicate, int...)} - listening
 *          to local grid events (events from remote nodes not included).
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Events and Performance</h1>
 * Note that by default all events in GridGain are enabled and therefore generated and stored
 * by whatever event storage SPI is configured. GridGain can and often does generate thousands events per seconds
 * under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If these events are
 * not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant performance degradation.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>highly recommended</b> to enable only those events that your application logic requires
 * by using either {@link GridConfiguration#getIncludeEventTypes()} method in GridGain configuration. Note that certain
 * events are required for GridGain's internal operations and such events will still be generated but not stored by
 * event storage SPI if they are disabled in GridGain configuration.
 * <h1 class="header">Internal and Hidden Events</h1>
 * Also note that some events are considered to be internally used or hidden.
 * <p>
 * Internally used events are always "recordable" for notification purposes (regardless of whether they were
 * enabled or disabled). But won't be sent down to SPI level if user specifically excluded them.
 * <p>
 * All discovery events are internal:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_FAILED}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_LEFT}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_JOINED}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_METRICS_UPDATED}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_SEGMENTED}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Hidden events are NEVER sent to SPI level. They serve purpose of local
 * notification for the local node.
 * <p>
 * Hidden events:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridEventType#EVT_NODE_METRICS_UPDATED}</li>
 * </ul>
