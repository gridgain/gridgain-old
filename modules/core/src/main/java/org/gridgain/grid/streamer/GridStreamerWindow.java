/**
 * Streamer rolling window. Rolling windows allow new event to come in, as well as automatically
 * evicting obsolete events on the other side. Windows allow to query into specific time-frame
 * or specific sample size of the events. With windows, you can answer questions like "What
 * are my top 10 best selling products over last 24 hours?", or "Who are my top 10 users out of
 * last 1,000,000 users who logged in?"
 * <p>
 * GridGain comes with following rolling windows implementations out of the box:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerUnboundedWindow}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerBoundedSizeWindow}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerBoundedSizeBatchWindow}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerBoundedSizeSortedWindow}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerBoundedTimeWindow}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamerBoundedTimeBatchWindow}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Streamer window is configured via {@link GridStreamerConfiguration#getWindows()} method.
