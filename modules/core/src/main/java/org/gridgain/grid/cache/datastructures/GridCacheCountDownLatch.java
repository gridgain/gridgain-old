 * Note that you cannot remove count down latch having count greater that zero. It should be
 * counted down to zero first.
 * <h1 class="header">Creating Distributed Count Down Latch</h1>
 * Instance of cache count down latch can be created by calling the following method:
 * {@link GridCacheDataStructures#countDownLatch(String, int, boolean, boolean)}.
 * @see GridCacheDataStructures#countDownLatch(String, int, boolean, boolean)
 * @see GridCacheDataStructures#removeCountDownLatch(String)
