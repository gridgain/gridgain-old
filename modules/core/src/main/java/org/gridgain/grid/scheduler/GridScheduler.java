/**
 * Provides functionality for scheduling jobs locally using UNIX cron-based syntax.
 * Instance of {@code GridScheduler} is obtained from grid as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridScheduler s = GridGain.grid().scheduler();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Scheduler supports standard UNIX {@code cron} format with optional prefix of
 * <tt>{n1, n2}</tt>, where {@code n1} is delay of scheduling in seconds and
 * {@code n2} is the number of execution. Both parameters are optional.
 * Here's an example of scheduling a closure that broadcasts a message
 * to all nodes five times, once every minute, with initial delay of two seconds:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridGain.grid().scheduler().scheduleLocal(
 *     GridSchedulerFuture&lt;?&gt; = GridGain.grid().scheduler().scheduleLocal(new Callable&lt;Object&gt;() {
 *         &#64;Override public Object call() throws GridException {
 *             g.broadcast(new GridCallable() {...}).get();
 *         }
 *     }, "{2, 5} * * * * *" // 2 seconds delay with 5 executions only.
 * );
 * </pre>
