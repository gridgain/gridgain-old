 * Data center replication receiver cache conflict resolver mode.

 * center ID which differs from local data center ID defined by {@link GridConfiguration#getDataCenterId()}, then
 * we consider such situation as conflict.
 * <p>
 * If both entries participating in conflict have the same data cneter ID (i.e. they both were replicated from the same
 * remote data center), then GridGain can potentially resolve this conflict automatically based on entry metadata.
 * <p>
 * But in case old and new entries have different data center IDs (i.e. in active-active scenario when cache is updated
 * in both data centers participating in data center replication, or when cache is updated from multiple remote data
 * centers), then explicit conflict resolution is required.
 * <p>
 * This enumeration provides several different strategies for conflict resolution.
