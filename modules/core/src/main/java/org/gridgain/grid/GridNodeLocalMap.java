/**
 * Defines interface for node-local storage.

 * {@code GridNodeLocalMap} is similar to {@link ThreadLocal} in a way that its values are not
 * distributed and kept only on local node (similar like {@link ThreadLocal} values are attached to the
 * current thread only). Node-local values are used primarily by jobs executed from the remote
 * nodes to keep intermediate state on the local node between executions.
 * <p>
 * {@code GridNodeLocalMap} essentially is a {@link ConcurrentMap} with a few additional methods,
 * so it is fairly trivial to use.
 * <p>
 * You can get an instance of {@code GridNodeLocalMap} by calling {@link Grid#nodeLocalMap()} method.
