/**
 * Defines grid projection which represents a common functionality over a group of nodes.
 * The {@link Grid} interface itself also extends {@code GridProjection} which makes
 * an instance of {@link Grid} a projection over all grid nodes.
 * <h1 class="header">Clustering</h1>
 * Grid projection allows to group grid nodes into various subgroups to perform distributed
 * operations on them. All {@code 'forXXX(...)'} methods will create a child grid projection
 * from existing projection. If you create a new projection from current one, then the resulting
 * projection will include a subset of nodes from current projection. The following code snippet
 * shows how to create and nest grid projections:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * Grid g = GridGain.grid();
 *
 * // Projection over remote nodes.
 * GridProjection remoteNodes = g.forRemotes();
 *
 * // Projection over random remote node.
 * GridProjection randomNode = remoteNodes.forRandom();
 *
 * // Projection over all nodes with cache named "myCache" enabled.
 * GridProjection cacheNodes = g.forCache("myCache");
 *
 * // Projection over all nodes that have user attribute "group" set to value "worker".
 * GridProjection workerNodes = g.forAttribute("group", "worker");
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Features</h1>
 * Grid projection provides the following functionality over the underlying group of nodes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridCompute} - functionality for executing tasks and closures over nodes in this projection.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridMessaging} - functionality for topic-based message exchange over nodes in this projection.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridEvents} - functionality for querying and listening to events on nodes in this projection.</li>
 * </ul>
