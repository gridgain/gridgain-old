/**
 * Wrapper for portable object in portable binary format. Once an object is defined as portable,
 * GridGain will always store it in memory in the portable (i.e. binary) format.
 * User can choose to work either with the portable format or with the deserialized form
 * (assuming that class definitions are present in the classpath).
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> user does not need to (and should not) implement this interface directly.
 * <p>
 * To work with the portable format directly, user should create a cache projection
 * over {@code GridPortableObject} class and then retrieve individual fields as needed:
 * <pre name=code class=java>
 * GridCacheProjection&lt;GridPortableObject.class, GridPortableObject.class&gt; prj =
 *     cache.projection(GridPortableObject.class, GridPortableObject.class);
 *
 * // Convert instance of MyKey to portable format.
 * // We could also use GridPortableBuilder to create
 * // the key in portable format directly.
 * GridPortableObject key = grid.portables().toPortable(new MyKey());
 *
 * GridPortableObject val = prj.get(key);
 *
 * String field = val.field("myFieldName");
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, we could also choose a hybrid approach, where, for example,
 * the keys are concrete deserialized objects and the values are returned in portable
 * format, like so:
 * <pre name=code class=java>
 * GridCacheProjection&lt;MyKey.class, GridPortableObject.class&gt; prj =
 *     cache.projection(MyKey.class, GridPortableObject.class);
 *
 * GridPortableObject val = prj.get(new MyKey());
 *
 * String field = val.field("myFieldName");
 * </pre>
 * We could also have the values as concrete deserialized objects and the keys in portable format,
 * but such use case is a lot less common because cache keys are usually a lot smaller than values, and
 * it may be very cheap to deserialize the keys, but not the values.
 * <p>
 * And finally, if we have class definitions in the classpath, we may choose to work with deserialized
 * typed objects at all times. In this case we do incur the deserialization cost, however,
 * GridGain will only deserialize on the first access and will cache the deserialized object,
 * so it does not have to be deserialized again:
 * <pre name=code class=java>
 * GridCacheProjection&lt;MyKey.class, MyValue.class&gt; prj =
 *     cache.projection(MyKey.class, MyValue.class);
 *
 * MyValue val = prj.get(new MyKey());
 *
 * // Normal java getter.
 * String fieldVal = val.getMyFieldName();
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Working With Maps and Collections</h1>
 * All maps and collections in the portable objects are serialized automatically. When working
 * with different platforms, e.g. C++ or .NET, GridGain will automatically pick the most
 * adequate collection or map in either language. For example, {@link ArrayList} in Java will become
 * {@code List} in C#, {@link LinkedList} in Java is {@link LinkedList} in C#, {@link HashMap}
 * in Java is {@code Dictionary} in C#, and {@link TreeMap} in Java becomes {@code SortedDictionary}
 * in C#, etc.
 * <h1 class="header">Dynamic Structure Changes</h1>
 * Since objects are always cached in the portable binary format, server does not need to
 * be aware of the class definitions. Moreover, if class definitions are not present or not
 * used on the server, then clients can continuously change the structure of the portable
 * objects without having to restart the cluster. For example, if one client stores a
 * certain class with fields A and B, and another client stores the same class with
 * fields B and C, then the server-side portable object will have the fields A, B, and C.
 * As the structure of a portable object changes, the new fields become available for SQL queries
 * automatically.
 * <h1 class="header">Building Portable Objects</h1>
 * GridGain comes with {@link GridPortableBuilder} which allows to build portable objects dynamically:
 * <pre name=code class=java>
 * GridPortableBuilder builder = GridGain.grid().portables().builder();
 *
 * builder.typeId("MyObject");
 *
 * builder.stringField("fieldA", "A");
 * build.intField("fieldB", "B");
 *
 * GridPortableObject portableObj = builder.build();
 * </pre>
 * For the cases when class definition is present
 * in the class path, it is also possible to populate a standard POJO and then
 * convert it to portable format, like so:
 * <pre name=code class=java>
 * MyObject obj = new MyObject();
 *
 * obj.setFieldA("A");
 * obj.setFieldB(123);
 *
 * GridPortableObject portableObj = GridGain.grid().portables().toPortable(obj);
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Portable Metadata</h1>
 * Even though GridGain portable protocol only works with hash codes for type and field names
 * to achieve better performance, GridGain provides metadata for all portable types which
 * can be queried ar runtime via any of the {@link GridPortables#metadata(Class) GridPortables.metadata(...)}
 * methods. Having metadata also allows for proper formatting of {@code GridPortableObject.toString()} method,
 * even when portable objects are kept in binary format only, which may be necessary for audit reasons.
