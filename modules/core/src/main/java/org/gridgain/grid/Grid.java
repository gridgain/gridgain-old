/**
 * Main entry-point for all GridGain APIs.
 * You can obtain an instance of {@code Grid} through {@link GridGain#grid()},
 * or for named grids you can use {@link GridGain#grid(String)}. Note that you
 * can have multiple instances of {@code Grid} running in the same VM by giving
 * each instance a different name.
 * <p>
 * Note that {@code Grid} extends {@link GridProjection} which means that it provides grid projection
 * functionality over the whole grid (instead os a subgroup of nodes).
 * <p>
 * In addition to {@link GridProjection} functionality, from here you can get the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridCache} - functionality for in-memory distributed cache.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridDataLoader} - functionality for loading data large amounts of data into cache.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridDr} - functionality for WAN-based Data Center Replication of in-memory cache.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridGgfs} - functionality for distributed Hadoop-compliant in-memory file system and map-reduce.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridStreamer} - functionality for streaming events workflow with queries and indexes into rolling windows.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridScheduler} - functionality for scheduling jobs using UNIX Cron syntax.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridProduct} - functionality for licence management and update and product related information.</li>
 * <li>{@link GridCompute} - functionality for executing tasks and closures on all grid nodes (inherited form {@link GridProjection}).</li>
 * <li>{@link GridMessaging} - functionality for topic-based message exchange on all grid nodes (inherited form {@link GridProjection}).</li>
 * <li>{@link GridEvents} - functionality for querying and listening to events on all grid nodes  (inherited form {@link GridProjection}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@code Grid} also provides a handle on {@link #nodeLocalMap()} which provides map-like functionality
 * linked to current grid node. Node-local map is useful for saving shared state between job executions
 * on the grid. Additionally you can also ping, start, and restart remote nodes, map keys to caching nodes,
 * and get other useful information about topology.
