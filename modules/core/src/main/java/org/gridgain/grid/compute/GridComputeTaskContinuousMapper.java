/**
 * Defines a mapper that can be used for asynchronous job sending. Useful for
 * streaming jobs within the same task. Note that if job number within a task
 * grows too large, it is best to attach {@link GridComputeTaskNoResultCache} annotation
 * to task to make sure that collection of job results and job siblings does
 * not grow indefinitely.
 * <p>
 * Continuous mapper methods can be used right after it injected into a task.
 * Mapper can not be used after {@link GridComputeTask#result(GridComputeJobResult, List)}
 * method returned the {@link GridComputeJobResultPolicy#REDUCE} policy. Also if
 * {@link GridComputeTask#result(GridComputeJobResult, List)} method returned the
 * {@link GridComputeJobResultPolicy#WAIT} policy and all jobs are finished then task
 * will go to reducing results and continuous mapper can not be used.
 * <p>
 * Note that whenever continuous mapper is used, {@link GridComputeTask#map(List, Object)}
 * method is allowed to return {@code null} in case when at least one job
 * has been sent prior to completing the {@link GridComputeTask#map(List, Object)} method.
 * <p>
 * Task continuous mapper can be injected into a task using IoC (dependency
 * injection) by attaching {@link GridTaskContinuousMapperResource}
 * annotation to a field or a setter method inside of {@link GridComputeTask} implementations
 * as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * ...
 * // This field will be injected with task continuous mapper.
 * &#64GridTaskContinuousMapperResource
 * private GridComputeTaskContinuousMapper mapper;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * or from a setter method:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * // This setter method will be automatically called by the system
 * // to set grid task continuous mapper.
 * &#64GridTaskContinuousMapperResource
 * void setSession(GridComputeTaskContinuousMapper mapper) {
 *     this.mapper = mapper;
 * }
 * </pre>
