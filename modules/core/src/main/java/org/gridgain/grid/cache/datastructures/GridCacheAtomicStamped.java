/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with distributed atomic stamped value.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Functionality</h1>
 * Distributed atomic stamped includes the following main functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #get()} synchronously gets both value and stamp of atomic.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #value()} synchronously gets current value of atomic.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #stamp()} synchronously gets current stamp of atomic.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #set(Object, Object)} synchronously and unconditionally sets the value
 * and the stamp in the atomic.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Methods {@code compareAndSet(...)} synchronously and conditionally set the value
 * and the stamp in the atomic.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * All previously described methods have asynchronous analogs.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #name()} gets name of atomic stamped.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Creating Distributed Atomic Stamped</h1>
 * Instance of distributed atomic stamped can be created by calling the following method:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridCacheDataStructures#atomicLong(String, long, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * @see GridCacheDataStructures#atomicStamped(String, Object, Object, boolean)
 * @see GridCacheDataStructures#removeAtomicStamped(String)
