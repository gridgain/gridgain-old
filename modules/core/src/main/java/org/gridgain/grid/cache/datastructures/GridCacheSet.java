 * Set implementation based on on In-Memory Data Grid.

 * or if set was removed.
 * <h1 class="header">Collocated vs Non-collocated</h1>

 * (governed by {@code collocated} parameter). {@code Non-collocated} mode is provided only
 * for partitioned caches. If {@code collocated} parameter is {@code true}, then all set items
 * will be collocated on one node, otherwise items will be distributed through all grid nodes.
