/**
 * Grid cache transaction. Cache transactions have a default 2PC (two-phase-commit) behavior and
 * can be plugged into ongoing {@code JTA} transaction by properly implementing
 * {@gglink org.gridgain.grid.cache.jta.GridCacheTmLookup}
 * interface. Cache transactions can also be started explicitly directly from {@link GridCacheProjection} API
 * via any of the {@code 'GridCacheProjection.txStart(..)'} methods.
 * <p>
 * Cache transactions support the following isolation levels:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#READ_COMMITTED} isolation level means that always a committed value
 *  will be provided for read operations. With this isolation level values are always read
 *  from cache global memory or persistent store every time a value is accessed. In other words,
 *  if the same key is accessed more than once within the same transaction, it may have different
 *  value every time since global cache memory may be updated concurrently by other threads.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#REPEATABLE_READ} isolation level means that if a value was read once
 *  within transaction, then all consecutive reads will provide the same in-transaction value. With
 *  this isolation level accessed values are stored within in-transaction memory, so consecutive access
 *  to the same key within the same transaction will always return the value that was previously read or
 *  updated within this transaction. If concurrency is {@link GridCacheTxConcurrency#PESSIMISTIC}, then a lock
 *  on the key will be acquired prior to accessing the value.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#SERIALIZABLE} isolation level means that all transactions occur in a completely
 *  isolated fashion, as if all transactions in the system had executed serially, one after the other.
 *  Read access with this level happens the same way as with {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#REPEATABLE_READ} level.
 *  However, in {@link GridCacheTxConcurrency#OPTIMISTIC} mode, if some transactions cannot be serially isolated
 *  from each other, then one winner will be picked and the other transactions in conflict will result in
 * {@link GridCacheTxOptimisticException} being thrown.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Cache transactions support the following concurrency models:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  {@link GridCacheTxConcurrency#OPTIMISTIC} - in this mode all cache operations are not distributed to other
 *  nodes until {@link #commit()} or {@link #commitAsync()} are called. In this mode one {@code 'PREPARE'}
 *  message will be sent to participating cache nodes to start acquiring per-transaction locks, and once
 *  all nodes reply {@code 'OK'} (i.e. {@code Phase 1} completes successfully), a one-way' {@code 'COMMIT'}
 *  message is sent without waiting for reply. If it is necessary to know whenever remote nodes have committed
 *  as well, synchronous commit or synchronous rollback should be enabled via
 *  {@link GridCacheConfiguration#setWriteSynchronizationMode}
 *  or by setting proper flags on cache projection, such as {@link GridCacheFlag#SYNC_COMMIT}.
 *  <p>
 *  Note that in this mode, optimistic failures are only possible in conjunction with
 *  {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#SERIALIZABLE} isolation level. In all other cases, optimistic
 *  transactions will never fail optimistically and will always be identically ordered on all participating
 *  grid nodes.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  {@link GridCacheTxConcurrency#PESSIMISTIC} - in this mode a lock is acquired on all cache operations
 *  with exception of read operations in {@link GridCacheTxIsolation#READ_COMMITTED} mode. All optional filters
 *  passed into cache operations will be evaluated after successful lock acquisition. Whenever
 *  {@link #commit()} or {@link #commitAsync()} is called, a single one-way {@code 'COMMIT'} message
 *  is sent to participating cache nodes without waiting for reply. Note that there is no reason for
 *  distributed 'PREPARE' step, as all locks have been already acquired. Just like with optimistic mode,
 *  it is possible to configure synchronous commit or rollback and wait till transaction commits on
 *  all participating remote nodes.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Cache Atomicity Mode</h1>
 * In addition to standard {@link GridCacheAtomicityMode#TRANSACTIONAL} behavior, GridGain also supports
 * a lighter {@link GridCacheAtomicityMode#ATOMIC} mode as well. In this mode distributed transactions
 * and distributed locking are not supported. Disabling transactions and locking allows to achieve much higher
 * performance and throughput ratios. It is recommended that {@link GridCacheAtomicityMode#ATOMIC} mode
 * is used whenever full {@code ACID}-compliant transactions are not needed.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Usage</h1>
 * You can use cache transactions as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCache&lt;String, Integer&gt; cache = GridGain.grid().cache();
 *
 * try (GridCacheTx tx = cache.txStart()) {
 *     // Perform transactional operations.
 *     Integer v1 = cache.get("k1");
 *
 *     // Check if v1 satisfies some condition before doing a put.
 *     if (v1 != null && v1 > 0)
 *         cache.putx("k1", 2);
 *
 *     cache.removex("k2");
 *
 *     // Commit the transaction.
 *     tx.commit();
 * }
 * </pre>
