/**
 * API for configuring and executing continuous cache queries.
 * <p>
 * Continuous queries are executed as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *  Query is sent to requested grid nodes. Note that for {@link GridCacheMode#LOCAL LOCAL}
 *  and {@link GridCacheMode#REPLICATED REPLICATED} caches query will be always executed
 *  locally.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Each node iterates through existing cache data and registers listeners that will
 *  notify about further updates.
 * <li>
 *  Each key-value pair is passed through optional filter and if this filter returns
 *  true, key-value pair is sent to the master node (the one that executed query).
 *  If filter is not provided, all pairs are sent.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  When master node receives key-value pairs, it notifies the local callback.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <h2 class="header">NOTE</h2>
 * Under some concurrent circumstances callback may get several notifications
 * for one cache update. This should be taken into account when implementing callback.
 * <h1 class="header">Query usage</h1>
 * As an example, suppose we have cache with {@code 'Person'} objects and we need
 * to query all persons with salary above 1000.
 * <p>
 * Here is the {@code Person} class:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class Person {
 *     // Name.
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     // Salary.
 *     private double salary;
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can create and execute continuous query like so:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * // Create new continuous query.
 * qry = cache.createContinuousQuery();
 *
 * // Callback that is called locally when update notifications are received.
 * // It simply prints out information about all created persons.
 * qry.callback(new GridPredicate2&lt;UUID, Collection&lt;Map.Entry&lt;UUID, Person&gt;&gt;&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public boolean apply(UUID uuid, Collection&lt;Map.Entry&lt;UUID, Person&gt;&gt; entries) {
 *         for (Map.Entry&lt;UUID, Person&gt; e : entries) {
 *             Person p = e.getValue();
 *
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt;");
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt; " + p.getFirstName() + " " + p.getLastName() +
 *                 "'s salary is " + p.getSalary());
 *             X.println("&gt;&gt;&gt;");
 *         }
 *
 *         return true;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // This query will return persons with salary above 1000.
 * qry.filter(new GridPredicate2&lt;UUID, Person&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public boolean apply(UUID uuid, Person person) {
 *         return person.getSalary() &gt; 1000;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // Execute query.
 * qry.execute();
 * </pre>
 * This will execute query on all nodes that have cache you are working with and notify callback
 * with both data that already exists in cache and further updates.
 * <p>
 * To stop receiving updates call {@link #close()} method:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * qry.cancel();
 * </pre>
 * Note that one query instance can be executed only once. After it's cancelled, it's non-operational.
 * If you need to repeat execution, use {@link GridCacheQueries#createContinuousQuery()} method to create
 * new query.
