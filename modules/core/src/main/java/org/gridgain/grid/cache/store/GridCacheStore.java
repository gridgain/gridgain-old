/**
 * API for cache persistent storage for read-through and write-through behavior.
 * Persistent store is configured via {@link GridCacheConfiguration#getStore()}
 * configuration property. If not provided, values will be only kept in cache memory
 * or swap storage without ever being persisted to a persistent storage.
 * <p>
 * {@link GridCacheStoreAdapter} provides default implementation for bulk operations,
 * such as {@link #loadAll(GridCacheTx, Collection, GridBiInClosure)},
 * {@link #putAll(GridCacheTx, Map)}, and {@link #removeAll(GridCacheTx, Collection)}
 * by sequentially calling corresponding {@link #load(GridCacheTx, Object)},
 * {@link #put(GridCacheTx, Object, Object)}, and {@link #remove(GridCacheTx, Object)}
 * operations. Use this adapter whenever such behaviour is acceptable. However
 * in many cases it maybe more preferable to take advantage of database batch update
 * functionality, and therefore default adapter implementation may not be the best option.
 * <p>
 * Provided implementations may be used for test purposes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@gglink org.gridgain.grid.cache.store.hibernate.GridCacheHibernateBlobStore}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCacheJdbcBlobStore}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All transactional operations of this API are provided with ongoing {@link GridCacheTx},
 * if any. As transaction is {@link GridMetadataAware}, you can attach any metadata to
 * it, e.g. to recognize if several operations belong to the same transaction or not.
 * Here is an example of how attach a JDBC connection as transaction metadata:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * Connection conn = tx.meta("some.name");
 *
 * if (conn == null) {
 *     conn = ...; // Get JDBC connection.
 *
 *     // Store connection in transaction metadata, so it can be accessed
 *     // for other operations on the same transaction.
 *     tx.addMeta("some.name", conn);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Working With Portable Objects</h1>
 * When portables are enabled for cache by setting {@link GridCacheConfiguration#isPortableEnabled()} to
 * {@code true}), all portable keys and values are converted to instances of {@link GridPortableObject}.
 * Therefore, all cache store methods will take parameters in portable format. To avoid class
 * cast exceptions, store must have signature compatible with portables. E.g., if you use {@link Integer}
 * as a key and {@code Value} class as a value (which will be converted to portable format), cache store
 * signature should be the following:
 * <pre>
 * public class PortableCacheStore implements GridCacheStore&lt;Integer, GridPortableObject&gt; {
 *     public void put(@Nullable GridCacheTx tx, Integer key, GridPortableObject val) throws GridException {
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note that only portable classes are converted to {@link GridPortableObject} format. Following
 * types are stored in cache without changes and therefore should not affect cache store signature:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>All primitives (byte, int, ...) and there boxed versions (Byte, Integer, ...)</li>
 *     <li>Arrays of primitives (byte[], int[], ...)</li>
 *     <li>{@link String} and array of {@link String}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link UUID} and array of {@link UUID}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link Date} and array of {@link Date}s</li>
 *     <li>{@link Timestamp} and array of {@link Timestamp}s</li>
 *     <li>Enums and array of enums</li>
 *     <li>
 *         Maps, collections and array of objects (but objects inside
 *         them will still be converted if they are portable)
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
