/**
 * Implementation of node load probing based on CPU load.
 * <p>
 * Based on {@link #setUseAverage(boolean)}
 * parameter, this implementation will either use average CPU load
 * values or current (default is to use averages).
 * <p>
 * Based on {@link #setUseProcessors(boolean)} parameter, this implementation
 * will either take number of processors on the node into account or not.
 * Since CPU load on multi-processor boxes shows medium load of multiple CPU's it
 * usually means that the remaining capacity is proportional to the number of
 * CPU's (or cores) on the node. This configuration parameter indicates
 * whether to divide each node's CPU load by the number of processors on that node
 * (default is {@code true}).
 * <p>
 * Also note that in some environments every processor may not be adding 100% of
 * processing power. For example, if you are using multi-core CPU's, then addition of
 * every core would probably result in about 75% of extra CPU power. To account
 * for that, you should set {@link #setProcessorCoefficient(double)} parameter to
 * {@code 0.75} .
 * <p>
 * Below is an example of how CPU load probe would be configured in GridGain
 * Spring configuration file:
 * <pre name="code" class="xml">
 * &lt;property name="loadBalancingSpi"&gt;
 *     &lt;bean class="org.gridgain.grid.spi.loadBalancing.adaptive.GridAdaptiveLoadBalancingSpi"&gt;
 *         &lt;property name="loadProbe"&gt;
 *             &lt;bean class="org.gridgain.grid.spi.loadBalancing.adaptive.GridAdaptiveCpuLoadProbe"&gt;
 *                 &lt;property name="useAverage" value="true"/&gt;
 *                 &lt;property name="useProcessors" value="true"/&gt;
 *                 &lt;property name="processorCoefficient" value="0.9"/&gt;
 *             &lt;/bean&gt;
 *         &lt;/property&gt;
 *     &lt;/bean&gt;
 * &lt;/property&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This implementation is used by default by {@link GridAdaptiveLoadBalancingSpi} SPI.
