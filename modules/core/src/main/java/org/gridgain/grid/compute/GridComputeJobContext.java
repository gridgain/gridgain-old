/**
 * Context attached to every job executed on the grid. Note that unlike
 * {@link GridComputeTaskSession}, which distributes all attributes to all jobs
 * in the task including the task itself, job context attributes belong
 * to a job and do not get sent over network unless a job moves from one
 * node to another.
 * <p>
 * In most cases a job, once assigned to a node, will never move to another
 * node. However, it is possible that collision SPI rejects a job before
 * it ever got a chance to execute (job rejection) which will cause fail-over
 * to another node. Or user is not satisfied with the outcome of a job and
 * fails it over to another node by returning {@link GridComputeJobResultPolicy#FAILOVER}
 * policy from {@link GridComputeTask#result(GridComputeJobResult, List)} method. In this case
 * all context attributes set on one node will be available on any other node
 * this job travels to.
 * <p>
 * You can also use {@code GridComputeJobContext} to communicate between SPI's and jobs.
 * For example, if you need to cancel an actively running job from {@link GridCollisionSpi}
 * you may choose to set some context attribute on the job to mark the fact
 * that a job was cancelled by grid and not by a user. Context attributes can
 * also be assigned in {@link GridFailoverSpi} prior to failing over a job.
 * <p>
 * From within {@link GridComputeTask#result(GridComputeJobResult, List)} or {@link GridComputeTask#reduce(List)} methods,
 * job context is available via {@link GridComputeJobResult#getJobContext()} method which gives user the
 * ability to check context attributes from within grid task implementation for every job
 * returned from remote nodes.
 * <p>
 * Job context can be injected into {@link GridComputeJob} via {@link GridJobContextResource}
 * annotation. Refer to the {@link GridJobContextResource}
 * documentation for coding examples on how to inject job context.
 * <p>
 * Attribute names that start with {@code "gridgain:"} are reserved for internal system use.
