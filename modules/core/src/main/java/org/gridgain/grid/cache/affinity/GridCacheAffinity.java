/**
 * Provides affinity information to detect which node is primary and which nodes are

 * <p>
 * Mapping of a key to a node is a three-step operation. First step will get an affinity key for given key
 * using {@link GridCacheAffinityKeyMapper}. If mapper is not specified, the original key will be used. Second step
 * will map affinity key to partition using {@link GridCacheAffinityFunction#partition(Object)} method. Third step
 * will map obtained partition to nodes for current grid topology version.
 * <p>
 * Interface provides various {@code 'mapKeysToNodes(..)'} methods which provide node affinity mapping for
 * given keys. All {@code 'mapKeysToNodes(..)'} methods are not transactional and will not enlist
 * keys into ongoing transaction.
